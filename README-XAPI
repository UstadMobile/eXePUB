eXeLearning Experience API (XAPI) Implementation
================================================

The Experience API is implemented based on the Rustici launch method:

https://github.com/RusticiSoftware/launch/blob/master/lms_lrs.md

When xAPI parameters are provided the relevant iDevices will generate
xAPI statements and send them to the defined LRS given by the 
parameters from the Rustici Launch method.

The ID scheme and setup is as follows and a tincan.xml file is created
in the package root/tincan.xml as follows:

1. The base activity ID is on the Acitivty that as per the tincan.xml
spec has the launch element.  All other Activity IDs use this as their
base.  It is in the form of epub:UUID where UUID is the generated UUID

2. Other activities are in the form of the above prefix/page_id/idevice_id
where page_id is the id of the page containing the idevice (as per the opf)
and idevice_id is the generated idevice id (a unique serial number).  One
Idevice (eg. Multi Choice Question) may generated multiple activities (eg
for having multiple questions).  In this case the ID will be ideviceid_X
where x is the idevice's own internal id scheme.

iDevice generated Activities will have the extension key 
 http://ustadmobile.com/ns/tincan-ext-idevice with the value of the
idevice id itself.
